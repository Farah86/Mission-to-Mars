junior data scientiest Robin freelance astronomy who love to work with NASA someday she gather information anout the space while she was doing that an idea came in to her mind what if write a script to gather all the information about MARS .
she plans to build a space webpage that tell us all information that we need about the mission to the red plant(MARS) ,to accomplish her goal she used NO SQL database because internet information doesn't provide us with neat information as SQL want ,MONGO DB was a better choice for her.
